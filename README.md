PS: This was previously named BANanoMaterial however, due to this project being a wrapper of an existing rep named UOE, the name has been changed.

1. The structure of UOEBANano is the same as UOE however its for the BANAno framework and has been updated to reflect BANano functionality.
2. Component definition is almost 100% as per the UOE project and as that project is very well documented on the UOEDocs zip file, the expectation is that you can use that for reference, this project will not be documented like UOE due to time constraints.
